They give us a ciphertext and a key. Both mostly consist of alphabetic characters, so this leads us to believe that it is a vigenere cipher.
We use [this](http://www.mygeocachingprofile.com/codebreaker.vigenerecipher.aspx), we get the text as `if you think nobody cares if you are alive, try missing a couple of car payments. metro-zwvn-4588`
so the password is `metro-zwvn-4588`.
